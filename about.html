									<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
									<p>I am Mahyar, a Civil Engineer turned Data Scientist based in Vancouver, Canada.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/photo_4.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>As a civil engineering master's degree holder with over 6 years of experience in the industry and a diploma in data science from BrainStation and the University of Tehran, I have always been passionate about using data and technology to improve infrastructure projects and make a positive impact on the world. I have always been driven by a desire to understand the world around me and to use my skills to solve problems.</p>
								<p>With a strong background in civil engineering and a desire to stay ahead of the curve, I decided to take my career to the next level by transitioning into the field of data science. Before starting to study data science, I took some courses in Back-end and Front-end Development ( Python, Microsoft SQL Server, Django, HTML/CSS ) and UI/UX design ( Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch ) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the field. I have since completed a diploma in data science from BrainStation and the University of Tehran. These skills, combined with my background in civil engineering, have equipped me with the knowledge and expertise necessary to excel in the data science industry.</p>
								<p>I pride myself on being a strong problem solver, with high interpersonal skills, and a deep curiosity for understanding the products and technologies I work with. I am an adaptable and critical thinker with a strong team player attitude, always willing to collaborate and share my expertise to achieve common goals.</p>
								<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, which I have been playing since childhood. I also enjoy playing tennis, working out, and staying active. These activities not only give me a great sense of physical well-being but also help me to develop a clear and focused mind, which I believe is essential for success in my field.</p>
								<p>I am now eager to put my skills to work and make a real impact in this exciting field. Whether using data to optimize infrastructure projects, designing intuitive interfaces for data analysis, or developing cutting-edge algorithms for machine learning, I am committed to using my skills and experience to drive innovation and improve the lives of others.</p>
								<p>If you are looking for a data scientist with a strong background in civil engineering and a passion for using data to drive change, I would love to connect and discuss how we can work together to achieve our goals : <a  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mahyar-sabouniaghdam/" > @M A H Y A R</a> </p>
